# Next Steps
Composer is nice. But it is limited in many ways. 
Also word on the street is Fabric is going to introduce similar functionality in fabric so composer won’t be necessary.

So you might ask, “Did I waste my time tonight at the meetup?”
Not quite. Composer will still be a great tool for quick prototyping of Blockchain Network. It will continue to be backward compatible with fabric with future versions of fabric although no new functionality will be introduced.
